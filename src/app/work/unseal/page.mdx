## Overview

In early 2019, Sheraton Atlanta Hotel approached us with the goal of maximizing the versatility of their banquet halls and restaurant spaces. As a premier hospitality brand, Sheraton Atlanta needed a solution that could cater to the diverse needs of events such as weddings, corporate meetings, and private dining experiences.

Our solution was to install high-quality movable partition systems specifically designed for the hospitality industry. These partitions allow Sheraton Atlanta to create smaller, intimate spaces or open up larger areas as needed, all while maintaining a luxurious aesthetic that aligns with their brand standards.

The results speak for themselves: Sheraton Atlanta can now host multiple events simultaneously or quickly adapt their spaces to meet client demands, significantly enhancing their operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.
