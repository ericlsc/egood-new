## Overview

In early 2017, Hosanna Church Brisbane approached us to address a recurring challenge: making their large worship hall adaptable for events of different sizes. They required a solution that could divide the hall into smaller, functional spaces while maintaining superior soundproofing.

We engineered and installed custom acoustic partition panels standing 3500mm tall with an STC (Sound Transmission Class) rating of 32db. These partitions allowed the church to host multiple activities simultaneously, such as a worship service in one section and smaller group discussions in another, without noise interference.

The result is a more functional, versatile space that meets the dynamic needs of the church and its community.
